## Java Design Pattern
Java design patterns are divided into three categories - behavioral, creational and structural design patterns.

### Behavioral Design Pattern
There are eleven behavioral design patterns:
 - Chain Responsibility
 - Command Pattern
 - Interpreter
 - Iterator
 - Mediator
 - Memento
 - Observer
 - State
 - Strategy
 - Template Method
 - Visitor

### Creational Design Pattern
There are five creational design patterns:
- Builder
- Abstract Factory
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural Design Pattern
There are seven structural design patterns:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Getting Started
This repository is created to have a quick references of those design patterns. 
### Running the Application 
Classes for each design pattern are placed to its own package. There is a Test class (name ends with Test) in each package with a main() method to run and verify respective design pattern.

## Declaration 
There are blogs/tutorials where the design patterns are fully explained. For quick reference the URLs are provided in each Test class documentation. If any code is taken from any tutorial/blog, that URL is also mentioned in Test class documentation and the credit goes to the respective owner. Mentioning few websites to learn the design patterns:
